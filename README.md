# Console-Finances
Unit 4 Challenge: Console Finances

Analyse the Data and Display the results to the console. 

## User Requirements
Analysis needs to output the following...
1) Total Number of Months.
2) Total net Profit or Loss.
3) Average Monthly Change.
4) Greatest Increase In Profits.
5) Greatest Loss in Any Individual Month.

## Problems solved
1) Accesing nested arrays, That was a challenge.
2) Looping through the months and auto-generating a new array of monthly changes.
3) Once I'd found the Greatest Increase & Decrease, then displaying it with it's corresponding month.
4) Getting the Math.Round() function working took some research. 
5) DRY code, original code contains 3 for loops, which can be condessed ino one.
